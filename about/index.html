	<h1>About me, Corey Martin</h1>
	<p>I've worked in software development and automation for over 10 years, principally in LabVIEW.  I have a <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/66e1fb02-43df-46c7-aaf9-c49be9c5ffc1">current CLD</a>, but also dabble in other languages and platforms, as evidenced by this "website".</p>
	<p>Recreationally, I play drums, guitar, and piano in decending order of tolerability, and drive around in my sandrail built from a 1971 Volkswagen Beetle drivetrain when it's in working oder.</p>
