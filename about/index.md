	<p>Hi, I'm Corey Martin.  I've worked in automation and software/algorith development for over 10 years, coding principally in LabVIEW.  I have a <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/66e1fb02-43df-46c7-aaf9-c49be9c5ffc1">current CLD</a>, but also dabble in other languages and platforms, as evidenced by this "website".</p>
	<p>Recreationally, I run, play music (drums, guitar, and piano in decending order of tolerability), and tool around town in my sandrail built from a 1971 Volkswagen Beetle.</p>
