# About me, Corey Martin

Hi, I'm Corey Martin.  I've worked in automation and software/algorithm development for over 10 years, coding principally in LabVIEW.  I am a [Certified LabVIEW Developer](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/66e1fb02-43df-46c7-aaf9-c49be9c5ffc1), but also dabble in other languages and platforms, as evidenced by this "website".

I hold a B.S. in Physics from NC State University.

Recreationally, I run, play music, and tool around town in my sandrail built from a 1971 Volkswagen Beetle.
