# About me, Corey Martin
<img align="left" src="/about/aboutme.jpg" alt="Me: Corey Martin" width="240" style="margin-right:1em; margin-bottom:1em;" />

Oh, hello! I'm Corey Martin.  I've worked in automation and software/algorithm development for over 10 years, coding principally in LabVIEW.  I am a [Certified LabVIEW Developer](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/66e1fb02-43df-46c7-aaf9-c49be9c5ffc1), but also dabble in other languages and platforms, as evidenced by this "website".

I hold a B.S. in Physics from NC State University.  During my time there, I rose to the office of president of Riot House, an unchartered social organization.

Recreationally, I like to run, play music, and tool around town in my sandrail built from a 1971 Volkswagen Beetle.  I also work continuously on my yard and home renovation projects.
