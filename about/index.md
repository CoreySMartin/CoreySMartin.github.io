# About me, Corey Martin
![](./aboutme.jpg =100x100 "Me: Corey Martin")

Hi, I'm Corey Martin.  I've worked in automation and software/algorith development for over 10 years, coding principally in LabVIEW.  I have a [current CLD](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/66e1fb02-43df-46c7-aaf9-c49be9c5ffc1), but also dabble in other languages and platforms, as evidenced by this "website".

Recreationally, I run, play music (drums, guitar, and piano in decending order of tolerability), and tool around town in my sandrail built from a 1971 Volkswagen Beetle.
